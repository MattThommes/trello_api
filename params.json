The Trello interface is great, but once you have a lot of cards in a particular list, it's hard to visualize them all.\r\n\r\nThis script uses Node.js to fetch all cards from a certain Trello board & list. So once you have the list ID, you can use that to generate all cards in that list.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways to get the list ID, but I found just inspecting things in Chrome to be the quickest. Just drag the list (that you want the ID for) back onto itself (slightly drag away then right back):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Trello board - dragging a list](mattthommes.github.com/trello_api/img/trello1.png)\r\n\r\nIn the inspector you'll see a network request made that shows the raw list ID:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Chrome inspector - network request](mattthommes.github.com/trello_api/img/trello2.png)\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n\r\n\t'LIST NAME' cards:\r\n\r\n\t1. Label Name [Card Name here](https://trello.com/c/xxxxxx)\r\n\r\n\t2. Another Label Name [Card 2 Name here](https://trello.com/c/xxxxxx)\r\n\r\nYou can then copy/paste this output into a Markdown editor to view the HTML.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
